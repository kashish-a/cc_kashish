Hello and welcome to this repository!
I, Kashish, am a first year B.Tech student at IIT Guwahati. I hail from Punjab. My hobbies include dancing, cooking and learning new things.
I am very patient, perseverant and dedicated. When it comes to my tasks, I like to do them with perfection.

I want to contribute to Open Source projects as it can serve as a medium to enhance and practice my skills. The source code available in various projects can help one learn a plethora of new concepts and techniques. Open source projects not only help an individual but also the entire developer-kin out there. Hence, open source draws my interest and I want to contribute towards it.
